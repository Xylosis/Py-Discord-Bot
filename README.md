# Py-Discord-Bot

This discord bot is a project in order to learn how to interact with and utilize API's, how to interact with databases, and many more hard and soft skills to learn as a developer. The bots intended use is as a mini autonomous mod, as well as an entertainment bot with an interactive leveling and gambling system, and games.

This bot is very small right now, but will be updated in order to implement more features as they are thought of to make this bot more interactive and useful.
